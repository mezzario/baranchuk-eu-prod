None of that can be fully represented, much less duplicated, by anybody or anything else, including "big data" constructions. For most of the Industrial Age, companies have been obsessed with getting the attention of prospects and customers.

All the ski rental agencies in your matching area receive notice of your intent to rent, and in a few minutes, you have serious responses that exactly match your request. After a couple of conversations with the rental reps, you accept one, payment is made automatically, and contract is signed with your digital signature.

Or if you go to Germany and look for a SIM card for your phone, the list of mobile operators will have Orange and Vodafone, and not AT&T and Verizon. Possibilities are limitless.
